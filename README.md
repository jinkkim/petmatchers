## Background

Animal adoption is a big decision for a family. There are many adoptable animals in the world and people can find animal data online. We would like to provide available animal data with Petfinder API. People can find a match based on their preference such as breed, age, gender, color, temperament, location and visualize current available animals by category. We will analyze the pet industry and provide related cost or expenditure after adoption to help them make a decision.
